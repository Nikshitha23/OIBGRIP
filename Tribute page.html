        <p>Mother Teresa was born Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu in Uskup, Ottoman Empire (now Skopje, North Macedonia), on August 26, 1910. Her family was of Albanian descent. At the age of twelve, she felt strongly the call of God.From 1931 to 1948 Mother Teresa taught at St. Mary’s High School in Calcutta, but the suffering and poverty she glimpsed outside the convent walls made such a deep impression on her that in 1948 she received permission from her superiors to leave the convent school and devote herself to working among the poorest of the poor in the slums of Calcutta. .</p>
        <h1 style="text-shadow: 5px 5px 5px rgb(61, 60, 60);">Tribute</h1>
        <p>One of the greatest gifts God has given to each of us is our memory. Because of it we have images of wonderful things that have happened to us in the past by people who were so concerned about us. On a larger scale, the world now has a great memory of a woman called Mother Teresa. A simple nun who lived a simple life not just preaching the gospel, but living the gospel she preached. Anyone who has seen a picture in the newspaper about her or a television show about her has a great memory. She not only brought Christ to the people of the world, she was Christ in the memory of many who were touched by her. The leper, the Aids patient, the poor, the indentured, many of them have had dismal memories of the past, but this woman gave them a memory they will cherish forever. They will have a reason for hope. They will have a better life waiting them. They will have a God deep in love with them. No woman in the last one hundred years has created an impact on the memory of mankind as has Mother Teresa. When Christ gave the words, "when I was hungry, you gave me to eat; when I was thirsty you gave me to drink and naked you clothed me", Mother Teresa helped those words become reality in the lives of the unfortunate who had very few good memories. Her legacy will be known for compassion. Thousands of words have been spoken about her and what she has done for the downtrodden and the unfortunate. She gave love and it was unconditional. Dylan Thomas once said that love is gratitude with a memory. To Mother Teresa we can simply say, "thanks for the memories".</p>

             <p>
                Mother Teresa quickly translated this somewhat vague calling into concrete actions to help the city's poor. She began an open-air school and established a home for the dying destitute in a dilapidated building she convinced the city government to donate to her cause. In October 1950, she won canonical recognition for a new congregation, the Missionaries of Charity, which she founded with only a handful of members—most of them former teachers or pupils from St. Mary's School.
                
                As the ranks of her congregation swelled and donations poured in from around India and across the globe, the scope of Mother Teresa's charitable activities expanded exponentially. Over the course of the 1950s and 1960s, she established a leper colony, an orphanage, a nursing home, a family clinic and a string of mobile health clinics.
                
                In 1971, Mother Teresa traveled to New York City to open her first American-based house of charity, and in the summer of 1982, she secretly went to Beirut, Lebanon, where she crossed between Christian East Beirut and Muslim West Beirut to aid children of both faiths. In 1985, Mother Teresa returned to New York and spoke at the 40th anniversary of the United Nations General Assembly. While there, she also opened Gift of Love, a home to care for those infected with HIV/AIDS.

                    <li> "Be faithful in small things because it is in them that your strength lies." Mother Teresa</li>
                    <li>   "Joy is strength." ― Mother Teresa</li>
                    <li> "The person who gives with a smile is the best giver because God loves a cheerful giver." ― Mother Teresa</li>
                        <li>  "One of the greatest diseases is to be nobody to anybody." Mother Teresa</li>
                            <li> "Love to be real, it must cost—it must hurt—it must empty us of self." ― Mother Teresa</li>
                                <li> "We need to find God, and he cannot be found in noise and restlessness. God is the friend of silence.

             <h1 style="text-shadow: 5px 5px 5px rgb(61, 60, 60);">Death and Legacy</h1>
             <p>
                After several years of deteriorating health, in which she suffered from heart, lung and kidney problems, Mother Teresa died on September 5, 1997, at the age of 87. She was beatified in October 2003.
                
                On December 17, 2015, Pope Francis issued a decree that recognized a second miracle attributed to Mother Teresa, clearing the way for her to be canonized as a saint in 2016. The second miracle involved the healing of a man in Santos, Brazil, who was diagnosed with a viral brain infection and lapsed into a coma. His wife, family and friends prayed to Mother Teresa, and when the man was brought to the operating room for emergency surgery, he woke up without pain and cured of his symptoms, according to a statement from the Missionaries of Charity Father. Mother Teresa's canonization is expected to be scheduled for September 2016 around the date of her death.</p><br/><br/>
